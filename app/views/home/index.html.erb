        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I am a student seeking employment in the tech industry. I 
            have been interested in technology ever since I was kid. I 
            consider myself a motivated and an ambitious person, I always 
            look forward to learning new skills or improving the ones I 
            already have. I can pickup new things rather easily and quickly. 
            Computers and their problem solving is my everyday life. I looked into what you do here at <b><span style="color:rgba(0,119,130,0.9)">Vinted</span> </b>and I feel like I would be a great fit for you. I believe becoming a part of such an amazing team would be a perfect environment for me to grow. I'd like to bring value to the work you do here and be a part of your team.</p>
